Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. I chose TMDb Movie dataset to answer the following questions:

 1.The average runtime of the movies and distribution of runtime
 2.The Nature of relationship between Budget vs Profit, Budget vs Ratings & Rating vs Profit
 3.The movie with maximum profit and maximum loss from the data
 4.Check the ratings of the top 10 commercially most successful movies
 5.Count of movies with +ve profits over the years and the average profits by years

File Descriptions 

tmdb-movies.csv contains more than 10k movies from 1965 to 2015. It consists the budget, revenue, popularity, rating, release_year, runtime, cast, director and other movie related variables.

There is also a notebook available here to show my work related to the above questions. I have also uploaded the html file for the same.

Results

The results insights could be found at post . Please refer to this link to get a summary of my work.
